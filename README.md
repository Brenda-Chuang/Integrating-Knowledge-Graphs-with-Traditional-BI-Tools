# Integrating-Knowledge-Graphs-with-Traditional-BI-Tools
Master's Consultancy Project

## Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of my Master's program and involved collaboration with **InformSupply**, a client focusing on transforming business data management using innovative knowledge graph technology. The aim was to integrate knowledge graphs with traditional BI tools, such as Power BI, to enhance data visualization and uncover hidden relationships. The project transformed RDF data into a star schema for seamless integration, enabling advanced analysis using both networked and traditional visuals.

## Key Features
- **RDF Data Transformation**: Converted RDF data into a star schema, aligning it with relational database structures for BI integration.
- **Power BI Integration**: Explored multiple integration methods, selecting CSV export as the final approach for performance optimisation.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built two dashboards, one using ZoomCharts and another with Python NetworkX, to showcase networked graphs alongside traditional visuals.
- **Visualization Methods Comparison**: Summarised the strengths and limitations of ZoomCharts, NetworkX, and GraphDB built-in visuals.
- **User Interaction Testing**: Conducted testing to validate usability and collect feedback from users. Participants valued the simplicity of traditional charts for straightforward tasks and appreciated the depth provided by networked graphs for more complex analyses.

## My Role
### **Technical Contributions**
- - Explored and developed Power BI integration using multiple methods.
- - Designed and implemented the RDF-to-star schema transformation process and data modelling.
- - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard, using ZoomCharts visuals for networked graphs in all report pages.

### **Project Leadership**
- Led the project team, managed timelines, and ensured deliverables aligned with client goals.
- Collaborated with stakeholders, including the client and supervisor, to achieve project objectives.
