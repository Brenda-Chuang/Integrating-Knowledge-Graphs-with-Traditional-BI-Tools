# Integrating-Knowledge-Graphs-with-Traditional-BI-Tools
Master's Consultancy Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of knowledge graphs with traditional BI tools, such as Power BI, to enhance data visualization and uncover hidden relationships. RDF data was transformed into a star schema for seamless integration, enabling advanced analysis using both networked and traditional visuals.

---

## Key Features
- **RDF Data Transformation**: Converted RDF data into a star schema, aligning it with relational database structures for BI integration.
- **Power BI Integration**: Explored multiple integration methods, selecting CSV export as the final approach for performance optimization.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built two dashboards, one using ZoomCharts and another with Python NetworkX, to showcase networked graphs alongside traditional visuals.
- **Visualization Methods Comparison**: Summarized the strengths and limitations of ZoomCharts, NetworkX, and GraphDB built-in visuals.
- **User Interaction Testing**: Conducted testing to validate usability and collect feedback from users.
